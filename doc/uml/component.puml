title **Components' Relationships and their Roles**

' components

actor User as user

cloud "Chat Service" as chatService {
    interface "user interface" as userInterface
    interface "sending protocol" as botSendingProtocol
}

component "Bot\n(Original implementation or //defaultBot + Adapter//)" as bot {
    database "UserContextStorage" as botStorage
    note right of botStorage
    Concrete implementation
    of //UserContextStorage//.
    Store users' conversational state.
    end note

    component "Commands" as botCommands {
        interface "Commands.ExecuteFirstMatched" as executeFirstMatched
        component "echo" as echo
        component "weather" as weather
    }

    interface "Bot.Respond" as botRespond
    note right of botRespond
    Takes care of most important part of response operation.
    - Receive //Input//.
    - Fetch user's conversational context from storage.
     - If found, execute the next step with given //Input//.
     - If not, find corresponding Command for given //Input// and execute it.
    - Call //Bot.SendMessage// to send output.
    ===
    This is called from Worker,
    which means simultaneous calls may occur at any time.
    end note
    interface "Bot.SendMessage" as botSendMessage
    interface "receiving\nprotocol" as receivingProtocol
}
note top of bot
Concrete implementation of //Bot// interface.
For easier implementation,
use combination of //defaultBot// with //Adapter//.
===
Multiple Bot instances can be registered to Runner.
end note

component "Runner" as runner {

    component "input receiver" as inputReceiver {
        queue "chan //Input//" as inputCh
    }

    component "Worker" as worker {
        queue "chan func()" as workerJobCh

        [worker] as worker1
        [worker] as worker2
        component "Reporter" as workerReporter {
        }
        note bottom of workerReporter
        Concrete implementation of //Reporter//.
        Report statistical information.
        end note
    }
    note top of worker
    Group of worker goroutines.
    When a given job panics,
    recover and log stack trace.
    ===
    This is shared among multiple //Bot//s.
    end note

    component "dirWatcher" as dirWatcher {
    }
    note right of dirWatcher
    Supervise configuration files.
    When updated, re-build corresponding
    //Command/////ScheduledTask//.
    end note

    component "Cron" as cron {
    }
    note top of cron
    Execute //ScheduledTask//
    periodically.
    end note

    package "map[BotType][]ScheduledTask" {
        [alarmTask] as alarm
    }

    package "map[BotType][]*ScheduledTaskProps" {
        [alarmScheduledTaskProps] as alarmTaskProps
    }

    package "map[BotType][]*CommandProps" as commandProps {
        [echoProps] as echoProps
        [weatherProps] as weatherProps
    }

    folder "./config/{BotType}/" as configDir {
        file alarm.yaml
        file weather.yaml
    }
}
note top of runner
Takes care of other components life cycles.
To ease Bot development, this provides some mechanism such as
//cron//, //directory watcher//, and //worker//.
These resources are shared by more than one running //Bot//s.
